Administrative matters Twitter/Mastodon: A Mastodon account is preferable, if possible via https://archaeo.social. In the future, both channels should be used in parallel for the moment. Ideally, a common interface should be found to avoid duplicating workflows. Automatisms should be considered and implemented, e.g. when a new protocol is published. Matrix: If possible and provided, the internal communication channel should be moved from Slack to Matrix. The implementation of the move will be communicated on Slack and in the mailing list.</description></item><item><title>25th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-12-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2022-12-12/</guid><description>6 ppl attended

Organised by Joe Roe, Martin Hinz, and Clemens Schmid
Organisational information When: 2021-06-16, 09:50–12:20 (UTC) Where: Online, Room S (morning), Room P (afternoon) Abstract The increasing use of scientific programming languages (e.g. R or Python) is transforming the practice of quantitative archaeology. This “tool-driven revolution” (Schmidt and Marwick 2020) promises to greatly improve the accessibility, power, and reproducibility of computational analyses.</description></item><item><title>Workshop I</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/workshopi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/workshopi/</guid><description>S31 Workshop: Developing R packages? Sophie C. Schmidt, Petr Pajdla, Clemens Schmid
Organisational information When: 2021-06-14, Details unkown Where: Online, Details unknown
Abstract A growing number of researchers use the scripting language R (R Core Team 2020) for scientific data analysis. Many organise their code in scripts and functions to perform sequences of data manipulation, statistics and visualisation. Sometimes these workflows gain in complexity and it becomes feasible to outsource core components into a dedicated R package.</description></item><item><title>8th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</guid><description>9 ppl attended

Clemens Schmid, Martin Hinz
Update: As CAA2020 is not going to take place this session will not happen either. We will think about the concept and may resubmit for CAA 2021.
Pre-session discussion: https://github.com/sslarch/caa2020_hackathon/issues
Abstract Scientific scripting languages are a very powerful tool for scientists to translate research questions and quantitative analysis into a machine-readable, executable and thus reproducible form. In order to promote and support their dissemination to the archaeological community, we have de facto established the Special Interest Group for Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology at CAA2019 in Krakow.</description></item><item><title>CAA2019 Roundtable Discussion</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2019-04-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2019-04-24/</guid><description>Introductory Statements

Abstract In general, scientific scripting languages are the best interface for archaeologists to translate research questions into a machine-readable and executable form for quantitative analysis. For every step of data processing – data acquisition, analysis and presentation – there are high-quality software frameworks that enable fast, elegant, human-readable and reproducible coding.</description></item><item><title>Statement of purpose</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/about/</guid><description>SIG SSLA The purpose of the CAA Special Interest Group Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology is to promote the widespread implementation of computer scripts in archaeology. We will provide an exchange platform for scientists in and around archaeology who use scripting languages to conduct major or minor parts of their research. Scripts are computer programs that automate the execution of various kinds of tasks and are typically used by scientists to process and visualize information in ways that are amenable to the principles of open research.</description></item><item><title>Ben Marwick</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Bjørn Peare Bartholdy</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Clemens Schmid</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>David N.

What is needed to become a member As for the prerequisites, there are really none, except an interest in advancing transparency in archaeological research through both human and machine-readable computer programs.</description></item><item><title>James Allison</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Joe Roe</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Joseph Lewis</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Letter to the members of the SIG</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/letter_members_bid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/letter_members_bid/</guid><description>Dear colleagues,
You are receiving this message because you are listed on the mailing list as a potential member of a CAA Special Interest Group (SIG) &amp;lsquo;Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology&amp;rsquo;.
This year at the CAA 2020 in Oxford we will submit a bid to have this group accepted as an official SIG of the CAA. In a preliminary enquiry to the CAA, we were told that we should illustrate in the bid that we already have support, preferably by compiling a list of archaeologists expressing their interest in the new SIG.</description></item><item><title>Martin Hinz</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Miguel Carrero</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Mikel Díaz</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Peter Demján</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Petr Pajdla</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Sébastien Plutniak</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Sophie Schmidt</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Special interest group proposal</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/caa_proposal/</guid><description>Dear honourable members of the CAA Steering Committee,
With this letter, we would like to express our intention to establish a CAA Special Interest Group for Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology (SIG-SSLA) under the auspices of the CAA. The idea for this SIG was developed in 2018 in a session on R as an archaeological tool. Out of this event and the resulting discussions, it was proposed to form such a Special Interest Group to create a permanent platform for the exchange and discussion of ideas and to develop the practical use of R for archaeological applications.</description></item><item><title>Thomas Huet</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item><item><title>Twitter guidelines</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/twitter_guidelines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/documents/twitter_guidelines/</guid><description>We can collect here what we would like to use Twitter for dissemination of new packages, releases etc. dissemination of actions planned by the SIG point of contact for outsiders amplify and support the work done by individuals and other collectives that relates to our core mission generally promote scientific computing as a cool thing to do 8-) Curation rolling by a team of volunteers gathering of ideas by all members of the SIG Rules do not post or share harmful, offensive or illegal content, including that which is racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ableist or which hatefully targets a religious group do not share personal information about any specific individual without their express consent (i.</description></item><item><title>Zack Batist</title><link/><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid/><description/></item></channel></rss>
