Organisational matters Duration of the SIG SSLA steering committee election cycle We did not make a decision about this when we elected the commitee The members present in this meeting have no strong opinion about the matter Ideally the full committee would not be replaced at once. Instead a certain overlap of members should uphold continuity The current committee (Martin Hinz, Sophie Schmidt, Clemens Schmid) will prepare a suggestion for the next meeting &amp;ldquo;How to join&amp;rdquo; instructions Martin Hinz prepared a guide with steps for new members to formally join the SIG Everybody liked it - except for the name &amp;ldquo;Boarding guide&amp;rdquo;, which should be changed (according to the native speakers) A link to the document can be found in the Slack channel The document is available for review until 2021-07-08.</description></item><item><title>8th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-06-04/</guid><description>9 ppl attended

Organisational issues Twitter account update According to the plans made during the last meeting, the twitter team followed a more strategic approach this month This increased both activity and interaction with followers The plan for the next months can be summarised as: More engagement and less promotion to act less as entertainers and more like moderators (for meaningful user-user interaction) This will also include cooperation with https://twitter.</description></item><item><title>4th regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-02-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-02-02/</guid><description>8 ppl attended

Internet connection issues in this meeting again caused problems, though. Conferences, meetings and sessions International Mountain Conference 2022 (11.09. to 15.09.): Francesco Carrer hosts the session ID20: Geospatial technologies in mountain archaeology and invited us to submit papers. CAA2022 (09.08. - 11.08.): We discussed if and how the SIG should participate and came up with two events, which should generally cover the topics collaborative working, community building, commons &amp;amp; codes of conduct within the archaeological, scientific community and how modern, digital tools can help.</description></item><item><title>3rd regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-01-05/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2021-01-05/</guid><description>9(+1?) ppl attended

Organisational issues Twitter (some of these suggestions could become part of our Twitter guidelines) The account can be set up and should have the name CAA-SSLA Content collection can happen on our group chat The account should focus on archaeology and not so much on general developments in the scripting languages world Solid, hearty, high quality tweets should dominate Scheduling posts before posting and weekly/monthly collection posts may be powerful tools to increase impact We should post with one or multiple dedicated hashtags to allow for searching and filtering Regular tweets are better than random bursts of activity with weeks of silence in between Logo There are different preferences in the group We will organise a ranked poll to decide The winner of this survey will be announced at the next meeting Group chat software Each system has clear advantages and disadvantages For now we will set up a Slack channel Later we want to change to something more FOSS Upcoming conferences, meetings and sessions CAA2021 The SIG session &amp;ldquo;Tools for the Revolution: developing packages for scientific programming in archaeology&amp;rdquo; by Joe Roe, Martin Hinz and Clemens Schmid was submitted We did not discuss the planned, accompanying workshop Open exchange about activities and software updates Zack Batist: OpenArchaeo Update - https://open-archaeo.</description></item><item><title>1st regular meeting</title><link>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2020-11-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sslarch.github.io/minutes/2020-11-03/</guid><description>11 ppl attended
